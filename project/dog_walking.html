    <h2>Dog Walking</h2>
		  <p> Count on us to walk your dogs if you work long hours.  It is good to have your dogs taken out in the mid-day so they don't have to hold it or worst, go in your house.  We will walk your dogs, make sure they have water in their bowls and give them a little play-time.  Feel free to text us to ask how everything went, we will be happy to send you a picture if you would like one.</p>
		<p>If you are working your normal hours but you have to stay late and won't be home for your dog's evening walk and dinner, just text or call us and we will be right over so you don't worry and your dogs won't go hungry.</p>
		<span>$15.00 per day!</span></div>
